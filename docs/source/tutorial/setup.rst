Setting up the environment
==========================

First step is to setup the environment such that reproducibility is maximized.
In this tutorial we will use the conda environment manager to install python, pyrpipe and the required tools and dependencies into a single environment.
**Note:** Conda must be installed on the system. For help with setting up conda, please see `miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_.



Create a new conda environment
-------------------------------
To create a new conda environment with python 3.8 execute the following commands

We have provided a conda environment file, use it XXX

.. code-block:: bash
    
    conda create -n pyrpipe python=3.8

Activate the newly created conda environment

.. code-block:: bash

    conda activate pyrpipe
