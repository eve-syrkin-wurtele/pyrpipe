Tutorial
========

This tutorial provides introduction to pyrpipe. 
New users can start here to get an idea how to use pyrpipe APIs for RNA-Seq or other analysis.
This tutorial is divided into smaller sections.

First section describes the recommended way of installing pyrpipe and setting up conda environments.

Then, an introduction to basic RNA-Seq API is provided via a simple RNA-Seq processing pipeline example.

After that, there is information on how to extend pipelines using third-party tools and integrate pyrpipe into snakemake for more scalable workflows.
 
The latter topics provide cover details on pyepipe_engine, pyepipe_module and pyrpipe_diagnostic which provide many useful and helpful functionality.
